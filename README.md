Fianl Year Project title: A Mobile Application for the Monitoring, Responding and Analysis of Insects.


Description: In this project, I have set out to develop a mobile application called ‘Hwiza’ meaning grasshopper in English language, it is an application which an average user can use to collect images of insects based on their current location. The application will have the capabilities of working in an offline mode in case the user of the application is in a remote location without access to telephone network. The application should be able to post images collected by users to a cloud hosted server. 

The link below is the prototype of my final year project.
